## Building Ros1

### Prerequisits

- A release of ROS installed and active. So far all testing has been done with
  with the Noetic release.
  ```
  make provision_ros1
  ```

### Building

Once the prerequisits are installed and actived (the case of ROS) building should be as easy as: 
```
make ros1
```

## Building Ros2

### Prerequisits

- A release of ROS2 installed and active. So far all testing has been done with
  with the Galactic release but things should work with any recent ROS2 release.

  ```
  make provision
  ```

### Building

Once the prerequisits are installed and actived (the case of ROS) building should be as easy as: 
```
make ros2
cd ros2
source ./install/setup.bash
```
